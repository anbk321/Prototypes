# Prototypes
 A prototype is a primitive version of something that will, potentially, be iterated upon until it is a final product.  Whether it’s a mobile app, a website or even the oven you use to cook your pizza, all of those things ideally will have gone through a prototyping process. You can think of prototypes as drafts. Drafts that will be edited until published. It is through this process of iteration and development that products and services come to life.  So, is a sketch a prototype? It’s not. Mockups, sketches and wireframes are not prototypes. They’re useful and should be used in conjunction with prototypes but it’s important to make a distinction.  A prototype is used to understand and see how a product or application works, what it does and how you should interact with it. They’re simulations of how a finished product will work. Sketches, wireframes and mockups serve other purposes in the design and prototyping process.
